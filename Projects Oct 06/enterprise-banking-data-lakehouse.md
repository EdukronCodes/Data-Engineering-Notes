## Data Flow Architecture

### Theoretical Foundation of Banking Data Lakehouse Architecture

The banking data lakehouse architecture represents a paradigm shift from traditional data warehousing approaches, combining the flexibility of data lakes with the performance and reliability of data warehouses. This hybrid approach addresses the unique challenges faced by financial institutions, including regulatory compliance, real-time risk management, and the need for advanced analytics on massive datasets. The architecture leverages the medallion pattern (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure data quality and lineage while maintaining the scalability required for modern banking operations.

The medallion architecture pattern provides a structured approach to data processing that ensures data quality, traceability, and business readiness. The Bronze layer serves as the landing zone for raw data, preserving the original format and providing a complete audit trail for regulatory compliance. The Silver layer applies business rules, data quality checks, and standardization processes, transforming raw data into clean, validated datasets. The Gold layer creates business-ready aggregations, customer 360 views, and analytical features that power decision-making systems and regulatory reporting.

Azure Data Factory (ADF) serves as the central orchestration engine, providing enterprise-grade workflow management, dependency handling, and error recovery capabilities. ADF's integration with Azure Databricks enables seamless execution of complex data transformations while maintaining data lineage and governance. The orchestration layer ensures that data flows through the medallion architecture in the correct sequence, with proper error handling and retry mechanisms to maintain data pipeline reliability.

### Azure Data Factory Orchestration Flow

#### Master Pipeline: Banking Data Lakehouse Orchestration

The Azure Data Factory orchestration layer serves as the central nervous system of the banking data lakehouse, coordinating complex data workflows across multiple systems and ensuring reliable data delivery. The master pipeline implements a sophisticated dependency management system that ensures data flows through the medallion architecture in the correct sequence, with comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms. This orchestration approach provides enterprise-grade reliability and scalability, essential for banking operations that require 99.9% uptime and regulatory compliance.

The pipeline architecture follows a hierarchical structure where the master pipeline coordinates four primary sub-pipelines: Bronze Ingestion, Silver Processing, Gold Aggregation, and Snowflake Load. Each sub-pipeline is designed to handle specific aspects of the data transformation process, with clear input and output contracts that enable modular development and testing. The dependency management system ensures that downstream processes only execute when upstream processes complete successfully, preventing data corruption and ensuring data lineage integrity.

Error handling and monitoring capabilities are built into every level of the orchestration framework, providing real-time visibility into pipeline execution status, data quality metrics, and performance indicators. The system includes automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures, dead letter queues for permanently failed records, and comprehensive logging for audit trails. This robust error handling is critical for banking environments where data accuracy and regulatory compliance are paramount.
