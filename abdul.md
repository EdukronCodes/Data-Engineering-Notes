# Sales Data Consolidation and Analysis Platform

As a **Data Engineer**, I was responsible for designing and implementing a **Sales Data Consolidation and Analysis Platform**, enabling seamless migration from **on-premise SQL Server** to **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)** using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)**. The objective was to build a scalable data pipeline that could process, transform, and analyze sales data across multiple regions in real-time. To achieve this, I developed **Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines** to extract and ingest raw transactional data, including **customer orders, inventory levels, and revenue transactions**, into the **Bronze layer** of ADLS Gen2. This ensured that all historical and real-time sales data were available for further processing while maintaining **data lineage and traceability**.

Once the raw data was ingested, I implemented **PySpark jobs in Azure Databricks** to process and clean the data within the **Silver layer**. This involved **removing duplicate transactions, handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and applying currency conversions** for global sales data. Additionally, I integrated **external data sources** to enrich missing customer location details and product information, improving data completeness. To enhance performance, I optimized **data partitioning strategies**, significantly reducing query execution time and enabling **faster data retrieval for analytics and reporting**.

In the **Gold layer**, I focused on **aggregating and structuring the data** for advanced analytics and business intelligence. I integrated **Power BI dashboards**, enabling real-time insights into **regional sales performance, top-selling products, and customer purchasing patterns**. To ensure data reliability, I developed **automated data quality checks and implemented monitoring alerts** for pipeline failures. This project not only streamlined the **end-to-end data consolidation process** but also empowered stakeholders with **real-time sales analysis and forecasting capabilities**, allowing the business to make **data-driven decisions with confidence**. By leveraging **Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and PySpark**, I successfully built a **scalable and automated data pipeline**, transforming raw transactional data into meaningful business insights.
