Project 1: Sales Data Consolidation and Analysis Platform

As a Data Engineer, I was responsible for designing and implementing a Sales Data Consolidation and Analysis Platform, enabling seamless migration from on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). The objective was to build a scalable data pipeline that could process, transform, and analyze sales data across multiple regions in real time. I developed Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines to ingest raw sales data from on-premise SQL Server into the Bronze layer of ADLS Gen2, ensuring that all historical and real-time transactional data, such as customer orders, inventory levels, and revenue transactions, were stored in their original formats. This allowed for efficient data retention and lineage tracking.

In the Silver layer, I implemented PySpark jobs in Azure Databricks to process and clean the raw data. This involved handling duplicate transactions, standardizing date formats, and enriching missing fields using external reference data. For example, I automated the process of filling missing customer location details by integrating external data sources, ensuring data completeness. I also performed aggregations such as total sales per region, product category revenue, and customer segmentation to enhance downstream analytics. Additionally, I optimized data partitioning strategies to improve query performance, reducing latency in data retrieval and reporting.

For the Gold layer, I focused on delivering high-quality, structured data for business intelligence and analytics. I integrated Power BI dashboards with the Gold layer, enabling real-time insights into regional sales performance, product demand trends, and customer purchasing patterns. To maintain data integrity, I implemented automated data quality checks and alert mechanisms, ensuring that any discrepancies or failures in the pipeline were identified and resolved promptly. This project provided a robust, scalable solution for real-time sales analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making and optimizing business operations. By leveraging Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and PySpark, I successfully streamlined the entire data pipeline, transforming raw transactional data into meaningful business insights.
