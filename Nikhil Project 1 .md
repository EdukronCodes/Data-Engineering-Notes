```

## Data Sources and Their Characteristics

Each data source in our retail ecosystem serves a specific purpose and comes with its unique characteristics and challenges:

1. POS Transactions: These form the backbone of retail operations, capturing every sale, return, and payment method. The data is typically structured and arrives in regular intervals from multiple store locations. SQL Server and MySQL databases commonly store this transactional data, requiring reliable extraction methods to ensure data consistency.
2. Inventory Management System: This critical component tracks stock levels, product movement, and warehouse operations. Oracle and PostgreSQL databases often manage this data, which needs regular synchronization to maintain accurate stock levels and prevent stockouts or overstock situations.
