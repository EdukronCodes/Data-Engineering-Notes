# Shared Azure implementation handbook

This is a reference implementation guide for the six proposed project designs. Code uses illustrative tables and schemas. It requires Azure resources, approved source access, runtime configuration and synthetic/approved test data; the Markdown files do not provision or run Azure services.

## 1. Build sequence

1. Select one project and define a minimal vertical slice: one source entity, one transformation, one validated gold dataset and one consumer query.
2. Create a development Azure resource group, ADLS Gen2 account with hierarchical namespace, ADF instance, Azure SQL metadata database, Key Vault and Databricks workspace. For the Fabric project create licensed/capacity-backed Fabric workspaces and Lakehouses instead of assuming an Azure storage account is OneLake.
3. Assign workload identity permissions, catalog/table grants, storage ACLs and source access. Validate networking and DNS. Create separate development/test/production configurations before deployment.
4. Create raw paths and bronze/silver/gold Delta tables with explicit schemas. In Databricks use Unity Catalog storage credentials/external locations as appropriate; in Fabric attach the correct Lakehouse to the notebook.
5. Create control tables, register an approved entity and seed its initial boundary. Load a small synthetic snapshot, including intentionally invalid and duplicate records.
6. Build the source extraction pipeline, notebook transformations, reconciliation and publication gate. Record durable input and output locations for every run.
7. Implement one insert, update, delete and late-arrival scenario. Replay input twice. Validate the accepted result and recovery after a simulated failure.
8. Create a serving view/semantic model and validate both its numbers and access with consumer identities.
9. Add monitoring, CI/CD, infrastructure code, deployment parameters, operating procedures and a measured performance/cost baseline.
10. Scale only after correctness passes; use the project-specific acceptance controls before declaring completion.

## 2. Storage and metadata contracts

```text
landing/<source>/<entity>/business_date=YYYY-MM-DD/run_id=<uuid>/
bronze/<domain>/<entity>/                  # raw records plus ingestion metadata
silver/<domain>/<entity>/                  # conformed business records
gold/<product>/<dataset>/                  # accepted analytical datasets
quarantine/<domain>/<entity>/run_id=<uuid>/ # restricted failed records
checkpoints/<stream_name>/                 # one durable path per stream
```

These are ADLS examples. Fabric Files/Tables organization and managed catalog tables have their own locations. Do not manually move files inside a managed Delta table. Avoid subscriber/customer ID partitions; choose partitioning only after measuring date filtering, volume and file sizes.

```sql
-- Azure SQL orchestration metadata; add access, indexing and retention policies.
CREATE TABLE dbo.entity_state (
 entity_id varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY,
 accepted_watermark datetime2(7) NULL,
 accepted_run_id uniqueidentifier NULL,
 state_version rowversion
);
CREATE TABLE dbo.pipeline_run (
 run_id uniqueidentifier PRIMARY KEY,
 entity_id varchar(100) NOT NULL,
 old_watermark datetime2(7) NULL,
 new_watermark datetime2(7) NULL,
 status varchar(20) NOT NULL,
 source_count bigint NULL,
 target_count bigint NULL,
 started_at datetime2(7) NOT NULL,
 ended_at datetime2(7) NULL,
 CONSTRAINT CK_run_status CHECK
  (status IN ('STARTED','LANDED','VALIDATED','PUBLISHED','FAILED'))
);
```

Acquire a per-entity lease or use a serialized scheduler so two runs cannot publish the same boundary concurrently. Restrict configuration changes to reviewed values; table identifiers need allow-list validation because SQL parameters do not parameterize object names.

## 3. ADF incremental orchestration

```text
Lookup approved entity configuration
  -> acquire entity lock
  -> read last accepted boundary
  -> capture bounded source upper boundary
  -> create STARTED run record
  -> Copy bounded source rows into immutable run directory
  -> validate landing manifest / mark LANDED
  -> invoke Databricks notebook
  -> quality checks + reconciliation / mark VALIDATED
  -> publish accepted product
  -> compare-and-set accepted boundary / mark PUBLISHED
  -> release lock
Failure path: mark FAILED + preserve input + alert owner + release lock
```

For Fabric use supported Fabric pipeline/notebook/control-state mechanisms rather than assuming every ADF activity or connector is identical.

```sql
-- Bounded example query; timestamp semantics must be agreed with the source.
SELECT transaction_id, source_sequence, modified_at, amount, currency_code
FROM dbo.source_transaction
WHERE modified_at > @old_watermark
  AND modified_at <= @new_watermark;
```

A timestamp alone is safe only if the source's commit/update behavior guarantees it. Concurrent or late commits can otherwise fall behind the accepted boundary. Prefer source-supported CDC or consistent snapshots with a commit-ordered change boundary. If using a lookback overlap, deduplicate it and document residual risks. Use a timestamp plus key cursor for deterministic page ordering; this does not fix backdated updates or deletes. Timestamp extraction cannot detect hard deletes without a deletion feed or complete-snapshot comparison.

Advance state only after successful acceptance. Publication and Azure SQL state are usually in different transaction systems: use a durable publication manifest and idempotent reconciliation so a crash between them can resume safely. Never claim they are one atomic distributed transaction.

## 4. PySpark validation and deterministic deduplication

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F, Window

# `input_path`, `quarantine_path`, `silver_table` and `run_id` are validated job parameters.
schema = ('transaction_id STRING, line_id STRING, source_system STRING, '
          'source_sequence LONG, modified_at TIMESTAMP, '
          'amount DECIMAL(28,6), currency_code STRING')
raw = (spark.read.schema(schema).option('mode', 'FAILFAST')
       .json(input_path).withColumn('run_id', F.lit(run_id)))
# FAILFAST fails the batch for malformed JSON. An alternative permissive
# parser must explicitly capture corrupt records and quarantine them.
invalid = (F.col('transaction_id').isNull() | F.col('line_id').isNull()
           | F.col('source_system').isNull() | F.col('source_sequence').isNull()
           | F.col('modified_at').isNull() | F.col('amount').isNull()
           | F.col('currency_code').isNull())
bad = raw.where(invalid)
good = raw.where(~invalid)
bad.write.format('delta').mode('overwrite').save(quarantine_path)

keys = ['source_system', 'transaction_id', 'line_id']
# Assert one payload per key + source_sequence; contradictory ties fail
# rather than being silently chosen by nondeterministic ordering.
conflicts = (good.groupBy(*(keys + ['source_sequence']))
             .agg(F.countDistinct(F.struct('amount', 'currency_code',
                                          'modified_at')).alias('payloads'))
             .where('payloads > 1'))
if conflicts.limit(1).count():
    raise ValueError('Conflicting payloads for a source sequence')
window = Window.partitionBy(*keys).orderBy(F.col('source_sequence').desc())
latest = (good.dropDuplicates(keys + ['source_sequence'])
          .withColumn('rn', F.row_number().over(window))
          .where('rn = 1').drop('rn'))
latest.createOrReplaceTempView('transaction_latest')
```

Implement format, membership, uniqueness and reconciliation rules separately; null checks alone are not a complete quality framework. The subsequent MERGE target must already exist with a compatible schema. Run the critical quality gate before publication; a valid-row table may be staged even when the batch is held.

## 5. Delta upsert and deletion semantics

```sql
-- Spark SQL / Azure Databricks Delta; source is deduplicated and ordered.
MERGE INTO silver.transaction AS t
USING transaction_latest AS s
ON t.source_system = s.source_system
 AND t.transaction_id = s.transaction_id AND t.line_id = s.line_id
WHEN MATCHED AND s.source_sequence > t.source_sequence THEN UPDATE SET *
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;
```

Keep the source sequence on each current record. A later-arriving older update must not overwrite a newer one. For physical deletes, retain ordering in a tombstone ledger or soft-deleted current row if stale events can be replayed; otherwise an old insert can resurrect a deleted entity. Use delete operations only from an explicit CDC contract or an authoritative complete snapshot, never from absence in a partial batch.

Delta change data feed exposes changes already written to Delta. Enable/configure the supported CDF mode for the chosen Databricks runtime, checkpoint consumers, and plan retention/backfills. Do not promise indefinite history or assume Azure Databricks-specific CDF modes are readable in Fabric.

## 6. SCD Type 2 and historical joins

Choose an entity business key, tracked attributes and effective-time source. Use half-open intervals `[valid_from, valid_to)` and a sentinel or null end date. Assert no overlapping intervals and at most one current row per key.

```sql
-- Spark SQL historical dimension lookup.
SELECT f.transaction_id, f.line_id, d.account_sk, f.amount
FROM silver.transaction f
LEFT JOIN silver.dim_account d
 ON f.account_id = d.account_id
 AND f.event_ts >= d.valid_from
 AND (d.valid_to IS NULL OR f.event_ts < d.valid_to);
```

Count matches: zero requires an approved unknown/suspense policy; more than one is a critical integrity failure. For an out-of-order dimension change, recompute that key's timeline from ordered source history and identify affected facts. A naive close-current-and-insert routine can misrepresent late history. Hashes can compare attributes but are not business keys or proof of equivalence without canonical types/null handling.

## 7. Streaming state and replay

Event Hubs ingestion uses its supported Spark integration for the selected runtime. Persist the original source identifier, event ID, event timestamp and producer sequence. Keep one durable checkpoint per query and environment. Validate connector/authentication options against the installed runtime.

```python
# `events` is an already parsed streaming DataFrame from the approved source.
deduped = (events.withWatermark('event_ts', '2 hours')
           .dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark(['source_system', 'event_id']))
query = (deduped.writeStream.format('delta')
         .option('checkpointLocation', checkpoint_path)
         .outputMode('append').start(bronze_delta_path))
```

The two-hour window is an illustrative configuration, not an SLA. Verify runtime support for `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark`; if unavailable use an explicitly designed alternative with measured state behavior. Windowed deduplication expires state and can accept replays beyond the horizon. Enforce durable business-key idempotency in silver, retain raw data, and reconcile late partitions. `foreachBatch` handlers must be idempotent because microbatches can execute again; a checkpoint alone does not make arbitrary external writes exactly once.

## 8. Financial and operational reconciliation

Record expected and observed counts and decimal totals at matching grain. Counts alone can miss a duplicated row replacing a missing row. Combine key uniqueness, missing-key comparisons, signed totals, reference coverage and independent samples.

| Control | Expected evidence | Failure action |
|---|---|---|
| Manifest completeness | Declared files/rows vs landed files/rows | Hold batch and request missing delivery |
| Key uniqueness | Distinct business keys equal accepted record count | Resolve source duplicates/conflicts |
| Financial amounts | Decimal totals by date/entity/currency | Hold publication and investigate |
| Dimension resolution | Exactly one historical match per eligible fact | Fix timeline or agreed suspense policy |
| Freshness | Last accepted business timestamp vs target | Alert owner even if jobs succeeded |
| Replay | Same input creates same business output | Fix idempotency before go-live |

Define tolerance from an approved rounding/accounting policy; do not use an arbitrary percentage to suppress differences. Keep rejected-row counts in the balance equation. Test `source = accepted + rejected` where the extract contract and deduplication rules make that equation applicable.

## 9. CI/CD and infrastructure

Suggested repository structure:

```text
infra/                 # Bicep/Terraform, parameters, network/identity declarations
pipelines/             # ADF/Fabric definitions and deployment configuration
notebooks/             # parameterized PySpark transformations
sql/                   # metadata DDL and engine-specific serving objects
contracts/             # reviewed schemas and data-product definitions
tests/fixtures/        # synthetic examples and expected outputs
tests/integration/     # connectivity/replay/reconciliation scenarios
monitoring/            # queries, dashboards and alert definitions
runbooks/              # recovery, access and cutover procedures
```

PR validation checks code/contracts and meaningful fixtures. Test deployment creates resources/configuration and executes the vertical slice. Production promotion uses a reviewed artifact, environment identity, approved parameters and release evidence. Fabric Git/deployment support differs by item type; verify the actual items before promising fully automated promotion. Migration rollback can require recovering data, not just reverting a notebook.

## 10. Performance, costs and observability

Measure extraction bottleneck, shuffle volume, skew, file counts, read amplification, concurrency and serving query latency. Tune one measured bottleneck at a time. Do not apply repartition, caching, broadcast joins, clustering or partitioning mechanically. Avoid tiny files and full-table scans in daily incremental jobs. Run maintenance only under the retention policy; aggressive VACUUM can remove replay/time-travel data still needed by consumers.

Monitor pipeline failure, accepted-data age, reconciliation difference, quarantine rate, streaming lag, execution duration and cost per accepted batch. Use ADF diagnostics and Azure logs where available; use Fabric monitoring and capacity metrics for Fabric workloads rather than assuming all internal events automatically appear in Log Analytics. Benchmark representative data and concurrency and retain before/after results.

## 11. Production recovery runbook

1. Identify the failed run, entity, boundary, input manifest and affected consumers.
2. Prevent concurrent publication for the affected entity; preserve raw input and error evidence.
3. Determine whether landing, transformation, quality, serving publication or state update failed.
4. Resume from the durable phase using the same business input. If publication succeeded but state did not, reconcile the manifest and advance state without appending duplicate facts.
5. Revalidate keys, amounts, quality and access; release only the accepted output.
6. Confirm freshness restored, communicate through the approved incident route, and document root cause and prevention.

Recovery objectives must be backed by tested infrastructure/data restoration. Delta time travel alone is not a complete disaster recovery strategy. Agree source retention, checkpoints, configuration backups, identity/network recovery and regional constraints.
