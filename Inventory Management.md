# Inventory Management System: Data Engineering Pipeline for Local to Cloud Migration in Azure

## Overview
This pipeline facilitates the migration of an inventory management system from a local database to a cloud-based solution in Azure. The goal is to ensure efficient, scalable, and real-time inventory tracking, data processing, and analytics.

## Architecture Components
1. **Local Database (SQLite)**
2. **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**
3. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**
4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**
5. **Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB**
6. **Azure Monitor** for logging and alerts

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
   - **Goal**: Collect data from local databases and systems for storage in Azure.
   - **Process**:
     1. **Export Data**: Use scripts or tools to extract data from the local SQLite database.
     2. **Data Transfer**: Utilize **Azure Data Factory** (ADF) to automate and schedule data transfers to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
     3. **Data Storage**: Store raw data in ADLS for future processing.

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
   - **Goal**: Process and clean data for further use in the cloud.
   - **Process**:
     1. **Data Preparation**: Use **ADF** or **Azure Databricks** to clean, transform, and format data in a suitable structure for analytics.
     2. **Data Transformation**: Apply business rules to ensure data consistency and quality across inventory items, vendors, and sales records.
     3. **Storage**: Store the processed data in a structured format in **Azure SQL Database** or **Azure Synapse Analytics** for reporting and analysis.

### 3. Real-time Streaming Pipeline (Optional)
   - **Goal**: Process real-time data (e.g., sales transactions) for up-to-date inventory levels.
   - **Process**:
     1. **Event Hubs / IoT Hub**: Capture real-time sales or stock updates.
     2. **Stream Analytics**: Use **Azure Stream Analytics** to process real-time data and send updates to the database.

### 4. Data Analytics and Reporting
   - **Goal**: Enable analytics and visualization for decision-making.
   - **Process**:
     1. **Data Aggregation**: Use **Azure Synapse** to run aggregation queries on inventory data.
     2. **Power BI Integration**: Connect **Power BI** with Azure SQL or Synapse to build dashboards for inventory trends, stock levels, and demand forecasting.

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting
   - **Goal**: Ensure pipeline health and data accuracy.
   - **Process**:
     1. **Azure Monitor**: Set up logs and metrics for pipeline activities.
     2. **Alerts**: Configure alerts for issues like data transfer failures or unusual inventory levels.
