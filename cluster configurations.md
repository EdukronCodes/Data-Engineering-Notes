# Cluster Configuration for Processing 60 GB of Data in ADF and ADB

To process 60 GB of data effectively in Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Databricks (ADB), configure the cluster with sufficient resources to handle data transformation and processing without latency. Below is the suggested setup for cluster configurations:

## Azure Databricks Cluster Configuration

### 1. Cluster Mode
- **Cluster Type**: Standard or Interactive Cluster
- **Auto Termination**: 30 minutes (or based on job runtime)
- **Spark Version**: Use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) Spark version, e.g., `Databricks Runtime 10.x LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.x)` for optimal compatibility and performance.

### 2. Worker Nodes
- **Instance Type**: `Standard_DS3_v2` or `Standard_DS4_v2` are good options for handling moderate data loads with balanced cost-efficiency.
- **Node Type**: Worker
- **Memory**: 
  - `Standard_DS3_v2`: 14 GB memory, 4 cores per worker
  - `Standard_DS4_v2`: 28 GB memory, 8 cores per worker
- **Disk**: SSD-backed storage for high-speed read/write access
- **Workers Count**: For 60 GB of data, a setup with **4-8 workers** should be effective for most processing tasks. Adjust as needed based on processing complexity.

### 3. Driver Node
- **Instance Type**: Same as worker nodes (e.g., `Standard_DS4_v2`) to avoid potential memory bottlenecks
- **Memory**: 28 GB (for `Standard_DS4_v2`)
- **Cores**: 8 cores
- **Disk**: SSD

### 4. Cluster Scaling (Auto-Scaling)
- **Min Workers**: 2 (for lighter workloads)
- **Max Workers**: 8 (to scale up for heavier processing)

### 5. Advanced Configurations
- **Spark Configurations**: Use the following configurations to optimize memory usage and resource allocation for processing 60 GB data.
  - `spark.executor.memory`: `8g` or higher
  - `spark.executor.cores`: `4`
  - `spark.driver.memory`: `8g`
  - `spark.driver.cores`: `4`
  - `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`: Set this to **200-400** based on data volume and transformations to optimize shuffling.
  - **Enable Auto Scaling**: Set to `true` for dynamic adjustment of resources during job processing.

### 6. Storage Settings
- **DBFS (Databricks File System)**: For staging data between ADF and ADB, and for any intermediate storage, ensure DBFS has sufficient capacity to handle 60 GB of data with an additional buffer for intermediate storage.

## Azure Data Factory (ADF) Integration Settings

### 1. Data Movement Configuration
- **Integration Runtime**: Use **Self-hosted IR** if on-premises data sources are involved, or **Azure IR** for cloud-based data movement.
- **Parallel Copy Activity**: Set up to enable parallel reads/writes to Azure Blob Storage or ADLS Gen2 to increase throughput.

### 2. Data Partitioning
- Use data partitioning or range-based partitioning in ADF to split the data across multiple processing threads. For 60 GB, splitting into partitions of 4-8 GB each can improve read performance and reduce job runtime.

## Estimation of Resource Requirements
- **Memory Requirement**: Total of approximately **56 GB to 112 GB RAM** across all nodes.
- **Compute Requirement**: 32 cores to 64 cores in total, assuming 4-8 cores per node.

This setup should handle a 60 GB dataset effectively, but you can adjust the configurations based on data complexity and performance needs.
