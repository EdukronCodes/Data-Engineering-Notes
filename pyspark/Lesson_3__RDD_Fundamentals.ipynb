    "\n",
    "**Objective:** These notes provide a comprehensive understanding of PySpark's foundational data abstraction, the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). While modern PySpark often emphasizes DataFrames/Datasets for structured data, a solid grasp of RDDs is crucial for understanding Spark's core execution model, fault tolerance, and for handling unstructured data or scenarios requiring low-level control.\n",

    "**1. Introduction to Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Theory:**\n",
    "    An RDD is Spark's primary, low-level data abstraction, representing an **immutable, fault-tolerant, distributed collection of objects** that can be processed in parallel across a cluster. Let's break down these terms:\n",
    "    *   **Distributed:** Data within an RDD is partitioned (split) and distributed across multiple nodes (executors) in a Spark cluster. This enables parallel processing.\n",
    "    *   **Resilient:** RDDs achieve fault tolerance through lineage (discussed later). If a partition of data on a node is lost (e.g., due to node failure), Spark can automatically recompute that partition using the graph of transformations that created it.\n",
    "    *   **Immutable:** Once an RDD is created, it cannot be changed. Transformations on an RDD create *new* RDDs. This immutability simplifies consistency and fault tolerance.\n",
    "    *   **Dataset:** It's a collection of data items (e.g., numbers, strings, complex objects, key-value pairs).\n",
    "    *   **Lazily Evaluated:** Operations (Transformations) on RDDs are not executed immediately. Spark builds up a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of computations, and execution is deferred until an Action is invoked (discussed later).\n",
    "\n",
    "    RDDs provide a low-level API offering fine-grained control over data placement and computation. While DataFrames offer significant optimization benefits for structured data via the Catalyst optimizer, RDDs remain relevant for:\n",
    "    *   Processing completely unstructured data (e.g., raw text, binary data).\n",
    "    *   Scenarios requiring precise control over physical data distribution and execution.\n",
    "    *   Understanding the fundamental execution model of Spark.\n",

    "    | **Immutable**    | RDDs cannot be altered after creation; transformations create new RDDs.     | Simplifies consistency, helps fault tolerance. |\n",
    "    | **Fault-Tolerant**| Can automatically recover lost data partitions using lineage.            | Provides resilience against node failures.     |\n",
    "    | **Lazy Evaluation**| Transformations are recorded, not executed, until an action is called.    | Allows for optimization, avoids wasted work.  |\n",

    "*   **Theory:**\n",
    "    Before performing operations, data must be loaded into an RDD. There are two primary ways to create RDDs in PySpark:\n",
    "    1.  **Parallelizing an existing Python collection:** Suitable for small datasets already present in the driver program's memory, often used for testing, prototyping, or distributing lookup tables.\n",
    "    2.  **Referencing an external dataset:** The more common method for real-world data, reading from distributed storage systems (like HDFS, S3, Azure Blob Storage) or local filesystems accessible by the cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Theory:**\n",
    "    RDDs support two types of operations:\n",
    "    1.  **Transformations:** These operations create a *new* RDD from an existing one (due to immutability). Examples include `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, `join`, `reduceByKey`. Transformations are **lazy** – they define a step in the computation plan (DAG) but don't execute until an Action is called.\n",
    "    2.  **Actions:** These operations trigger the execution of the DAG built by transformations and return a result to the driver program or write data to an external storage system. Examples include `collect`, `count`, `first`, `take`, `saveAsTextFile`, `foreach`.\n",

    "*   **Theory:**\n",
    "    As mentioned, transformations are **lazy**. Spark doesn't execute them immediately. Instead, it builds an internal representation of the dependencies between RDDs, known as the **lineage graph** or **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.\n",
    "    *   **DAG:** A graph where nodes represent RDDs, and directed edges represent the Transformations applied to create one RDD from another. It's \"acyclic\" because you cannot return to an older RDD state through transformations.\n",
    "    *   **Lazy Evaluation Benefits:**\n",
    "        1.  **Optimization:** Spark's Catalyst optimizer (more prominent with DataFrames, but applies conceptually here) can analyze the entire DAG and optimize the execution plan (e.g., combining `map` and `filter` into a single stage, rearranging operations).\n",
    "        2.  **Efficiency:** Computations are only performed when results are actually needed (by an Action), avoiding unnecessary work.\n",
    "        3.  **Fault Tolerance:** The lineage graph is the key to RDD resilience. If a partition of an RDD is lost (e.g., executor failure), Spark can trace back through the lineage graph and recompute *only the lost partition* from its parent RDD(s). It doesn't need to rerun the entire job.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Conceptual Example Walkthrough:**\n",
    "    Consider the `level_counts_rdd.collectAsMap()` action from the previous example:\n",
    "    1.  **Action Called:** `collectAsMap()` triggers the computation.\n",
    "    2.  **DAG Analysis:** Spark looks at the lineage of `level_counts_rdd`:\n",
    "        *   `level_counts_rdd` depends on `level_pairs_rdd` via `reduceByKey`.\n",
    "        *   `level_pairs_rdd` depends on `log_lines_rdd` via `map`.\n",
    "        *   `log_lines_rdd` depends on the external file via `textFile`.\n",
    "        The DAG looks like: `textFile` -> `map` -> `reduceByKey`.\n",
    "    3.  **Execution Planning:** Spark breaks the DAG into stages. Shuffles (like `reduceByKey` or `groupByKey`) typically mark stage boundaries. Within a stage, operations are often pipelined (executed together on a partition without saving intermediate results).\n",
    "        *   Stage 1: Read file (`textFile`) and perform the `map` to create pairs.\n",
    "        *   Stage 2: Shuffle the pairs based on key, then perform `reduceByKey` aggregation.\n",
    "    4.  **Task Scheduling:** Tasks (units of work within a stage, operating on one partition) are scheduled and sent to available executors.\n",
    "    5.  **Execution:** Executors perform the tasks for each stage. Intermediate shuffle data is written temporarily.\n",
    "    6.  **Result Collection:** Once Stage 2 completes, the final results are gathered by the driver for `collectAsMap()`.\n",
    "    7.  **Fault Scenario:** If an executor running a `reduceByKey` task fails, Spark notices the failure. It looks at the lineage and sees the task needs data from Stage 1 (the `map` output partition). It finds another executor to re-run the specific `map` task for the lost partition (or reads shuffle data if available) and then re-runs the failed `reduceByKey` task.\n",

    "**5. Caching and Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Theory:**\n",
    "    Because RDDs are recomputed by default every time an Action is called, this can be inefficient if an RDD is used multiple times (e.g., in iterative algorithms like machine learning or during interactive analysis). **Persistence** (or **caching**) allows you to explicitly request that Spark store an RDD's contents in memory, on disk, or both, after it's computed for the first time. Subsequent actions using that RDD will then read from the cache instead of recomputing its entire lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `rdd.cache()`: This is a shorthand for `rdd.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)`. It attempts to store all partitions of the RDD in the executors' memory. If there isn't enough memory, some partitions might not be cached (and would be recomputed if needed).\n",
