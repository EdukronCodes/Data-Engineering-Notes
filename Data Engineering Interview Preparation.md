Here are 20 interview questions based on a 60 GB data processing cluster setup in ADF and ADB.

## 1. Azure Databricks Cluster Configuration

1. **Why is it beneficial to use a standard or interactive cluster for data processing tasks in Azure Databricks?**
2. **Explain the purpose of the auto-termination feature, and why would you set it to 30 minutes?**
3. **What are the advantages of using the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Spark for cluster configuration?**
4. **How would you choose between instance types like `Standard_DS3_v2` and `Standard_DS4_v2` for worker nodes in Databricks?**
5. **Describe the role of SSD-backed storage in cluster configurations and why it’s recommended for high-speed read/write operations.**
6. **What factors would influence the number of worker nodes needed for processing a dataset of 60 GB?**

## 2. Driver Node and Worker Nodes

7. **Why should the driver node’s instance type match the worker nodes in terms of memory and cores?**
8. **In your setup, you specified `Standard_DS4_v2` for the driver node. What issues could arise if a lower-spec instance type were used as the driver?**
9. **When would you use auto-scaling in Azure Databricks, and what are the benefits of setting minimum and maximum worker counts?**
10. **What is the purpose of the `spark.executor.memory` and `spark.driver.memory` settings in a Spark environment? How do these impact performance?**

## 3. Spark Configurations and Optimization

11. **Explain how `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` affects Spark job performance and why you would set it to a range like 200-400 for processing 60 GB of data.**
12. **How does the number of cores (`spark.executor.cores` and `spark.driver.cores`) impact parallelism and data processing speed in Spark?**
13. **If you encounter memory bottlenecks, what adjustments could you make to the Spark configurations to improve performance?**
14. **In a cluster setup like this, what role does auto-scaling play in managing resources for varying workloads?**
15. **How would you troubleshoot an out-of-memory error occurring on your Databricks cluster during processing?**

## 4. Storage and Data Handling in Databricks

16. **What is DBFS (Databricks File System), and how would you use it for staging data between ADF and ADB?**
17. **For a dataset of 60 GB, how much additional buffer storage would you recommend on DBFS, and why?**
18. **Why is it crucial to ensure sufficient capacity on DBFS for intermediate storage when processing large datasets?**
19. **How does data partitioning in Spark affect performance, and what guidelines would you follow for partitioning a 60 GB dataset?
