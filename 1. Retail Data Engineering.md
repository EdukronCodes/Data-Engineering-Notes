# End-to-End Retail Data Engineering Solution on Azure

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to build a scalable and efficient data engineering solution on Azure to enable seamless integration, processing, and analysis of retail data. The solution provides real-time insights into sales, inventory, and customer behavior, facilitating better decision-making, optimized stock management, and improved customer experiences. It involves designing data pipelines for ingesting data from various sources, transforming and storing it in a data warehouse, and creating analytical dashboards.

## **Roles and Responsibilities**

### **Data Engineer**
- Design and develop data pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF) for ingesting data from POS systems, e-commerce platforms, and supplier databases.
- Implement **ETL/ELT processes** to transform raw data and load it into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Azure Synapse Analytics.
- Ensure data quality by performing deduplication, validation, and error handling using ADF Data Flows and PySpark.
- Optimize performance for data ingestion and transformation using partitioning, indexing, and caching techniques.
- Set up Azure Event Hubs or Apache Kafka for real-time streaming data ingestion.
- Create **batch and real-time processing workflows** to handle sales, inventory, and customer feedback data.

### **Azure Architect**
- Design the overall architecture using Azure services, including ADF, ADLS Gen2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks.
- Implement the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to organize data storage and transformation.
- Ensure the solution is scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective by leveraging Azure best practices.
- Set up monitoring and alerting systems using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for pipeline performance and error tracking.

### **Database Administrator**
- Manage the Azure Synapse Analytics environment, ensuring data is properly indexed and partitioned for analytical queries.
- Implement security best practices, including **role-based access control (RBAC)** and encryption for sensitive data.
- Optimize SQL queries and stored procedures for reporting and dashboard creation.

### **Business Analyst**
- Collaborate with stakeholders to understand business requirements for sales and inventory analytics.
- Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for dashboards, such as stock turnover, sales trends, and customer preferences.
- Work with the data engineering team to ensure data pipelines align with analytical goals.

### **Dashboard Developer**
- Build interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key retail metrics, such as:
  - Sales performance by region and category.
  - Real-time inventory levels and replenishment recommendations.
  - Customer segmentation and buying behavior insights.
- Integrate dashboards with Azure Synapse Analytics for direct query capabilities.
