## Details
- **Name**: Pavan  
- **Target Role**: Junior Data Scientist / Python Developer (GenAI & Automation)  
- **Experience**: Project-based (2 major projects)  
- **Primary Stack**: Python, Automation, APIs, Data Processing  

## Career Objective
Python developer with hands-on project experience in data processing, automation, and API integration, aiming to grow into a Data Scientist role focused on building intelligent, GenAI-powered data products. Interested in applying Python, machine learning fundamentals, and agentic AI workflows to solve real-world business problems and optimize operations.

## Roles & Responsibilities (Data Science–Oriented)
1. Developed Python scripts and services to extract, transform, and load data from REST APIs, files, and databases into analytical stores.
2. Implemented reusable data processing pipelines using Pandas and NumPy for cleaning, feature extraction, and aggregation.
3. Built automation workflows to schedule recurring data tasks, generate reports, and notify stakeholders via email or chat.
4. Prototyped ML and GenAI features such as text summarization, classification, and conversational data assistants using open-source models and APIs.
5. Integrated external APIs (e.g., CRM, ticketing, financial systems) to enrich internal datasets for analytics and modeling.
6. Wrote unit tests and validation checks to ensure data correctness and stability of Python jobs.
7. Documented scripts, endpoints, and data schemas to support collaboration with data analysts and engineers.
8. Worked with agentic AI patterns to chain multiple tools (data retrieval, transformation, insight generation) driven by high-level user goals.
9. Assisted in building dashboards and visualizations to present model outputs and KPIs.
10. Followed Git-based workflows and code review practices to maintain quality and traceability.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, requests, FastAPI/Flask basics), Bash
- **Data Handling**: ETL in Python, JSON/CSV/Parquet processing, API integration
- **Data Science & GenAI**: Basic ML (scikit-learn), text preprocessing, LLM APIs (OpenAI/others), prompt engineering, agent workflows
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter, simple CI/CD, Docker (basic), PostgreSQL/MySQL (querying)
- **Other**: Problem solving, documentation, Agile collaboration

## Projects

### Project 1: Automated Data Collection & Reporting System
- **Title**: Automated Data Collection & Reporting System
- **Description**: Built a Python-based system that ingests data from multiple SaaS APIs, processes KPIs, and sends automated daily reports to business stakeholders.
- **Skills**: Python, REST APIs, Pandas, scheduling (cron/Airflow-lite), email automation
- **Roles & Responsibilities**:
  1. Implemented API clients to interact with sales, marketing, and support tools, handling pagination, rate limits, and retries.
  2. Created transformation logic to harmonize metrics and compute KPIs such as conversion rates, retention metrics, and response times.
  3. Generated summary reports as HTML/PDF and distributed them via email/Slack on a fixed schedule.
  4. Added logging and error notifications to quickly identify and resolve failures.

### Project 2: GenAI-Powered Ticket Triage Assistant
- **Title**: GenAI-Powered Ticket Triage Assistant
- **Description**: Developed a GenAI assistant that classifies and summarizes support tickets, recommending routing and priority to support teams.
- **Skills**: Python, LLM APIs, text classification, embeddings, prompt engineering, simple web UI
- **Roles & Responsibilities**:
  1. Collected historical ticket data, performed text preprocessing, and labeled samples for supervised fine-tuning/validation.
  2. Used LLMs with carefully designed prompts to generate ticket summaries and determine priority, routing, and suggested actions.
  3. Exposed the assistant via a simple web interface / API for integration into the support workflow.
  4. Monitored performance using accuracy and satisfaction feedback, iterating on prompts and heuristics.

### Project 3: Agentic Data Insight Bot
- **Title**: Agentic Data Insight Bot
- **Description**: Created an agent-style Python bot that responds to business users' questions by querying datasets, running calculations, and returning formatted insights.
- **Skills**: Python, SQL (via connectors), LLM APIs, agent frameworks (LangChain-like), data visualization (Matplotlib/Plotly)
- **Roles & Responsibilities**:
  1. Implemented modular tools (SQL query runner, chart generator, report formatter) that the agent can call.
  2. Configured agent logic to decompose natural language questions into steps, invoke relevant tools, and compose final answers.
  3. Ensured safe query generation with schema-aware validation and permissions checks.
  4. Logged interactions to improve agent reasoning and performance over time.
