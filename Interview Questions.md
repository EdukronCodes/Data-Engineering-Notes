With the lock setting configured to CanNotDelete, an authorized user can read and modify the resource, but won’t be able to delete it. And with the lock setting configured as ReadOnly, an authorized user may only be able to read details of a resource, but won’t be able to delete or modify the said resource.

Q 329 – What is Azure RBAC?
Ans: RBAC stands for Role Based Access Control. It’s an Azure Resource Management feature that one can use to authorize fine-grained Azure Resource access management for users created in Azure AD. RBAC allows organizations to provide specific permissions to users for dealing with Azure Resources. On almost all Azure Resources, there’s a pane, known as “Access Control (IAM)” also called Identity and Access Management. Here, Microsoft Azure Classes in Pune define RBAC roles describing user and their privileges on the said resource. At the same pane, one can easily add a new user and assign him a role, that describes the user privilege on the said resource. Applications can also be assigned a role, so they can read or write configuration settings or data from the resource they are applied on.

Q 330 – What is Azure RBAC Role?
Ans: Azure resources of different types can be configured with a wide variety of permissions. These collection of permissions is called Azure RBAC Role. Roles grant users, permissions that they need to have in order to manage resources. The Access Management (IAM) pane displays the users and their assigned roles, as well as a new user can be added and a role can be assigned on him to manage the resource. Azure provides standard roles and one can even create custom roles.

Q 331 – What is Azure AzCopy?
Ans: AzCopy is an Azure-provided command line utility meant to copy or move data to Azure BLOB or Azure File Share in Azure Storage Account.

339. What is cloud computing?
If you have ever used Google's Stadia, Xbox’s Project xCloud, Playstation's PS Now, Netflix, or any of a hundred other services, you will have some idea of what cloud computing is.

As a core concept, cloud computing involves having something run far away and making the results available where you are. Scales can vary significantly depending on what exactly is being run. In some cases, it might take the equivalent of hundreds or thousands of consumer-grade systems just to process all the data. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are the largest publicly available vendors in this space and power a significant amount of the web today.

340. What are all of these aaS things?
It can be challenging to differentiate between all of the different “X-as-a-Service” elements that have emerged over the years. When it comes to Azure, there are three primary types: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): Involves someone else managing the hardware. Azure handles the physical equipment and associated connections, while your organization manages the software and licensing on those systems. This could be useful for temporary needs, like accessing a test environment without long-term hardware investments.

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): Builds on IaaS by adding operating systems and additional functions like high availability. Azure manages the day-to-day operations of the systems, allowing your organization to focus on deploying applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): The host manages everything, providing your organization access to an application. Examples include Exchange Online or Office 365, where your only concern is the subscription fee, with all other aspects managed by Azure.

341. What sorts of web applications can run on Azure?
Azure supports multiple types of web applications, including various flavors of .NET, node.js, PHP, Python, Java, and more.

342. What are three of the main products on Azure?
Azure Compute: Handles running virtual machines (VMs) and web applications.
Azure Storage: Manages up to 500 TB of file storage per storage account, with up to 200 storage accounts per Azure subscription.
Azure Service Fabric: Runs large-scale services like Skype, Azure SQL, and parts of Azure itself.
343. What are the two basic roles that exist within Azure Web Services?
Web roles: Run web applications written in languages like .NET and PHP and handle IIS-related elements.
Worker roles: Run web and standalone applications that do not require IIS.
344. If you are a user administrator, can you adjust the permissions of the Azure subscription?
With few exceptions, Azure roles and Azure AD roles do not overlap significantly: they have separate areas of access. Unless you are specifically a global administrator in Azure AD with the “Access Management for Azure Resources” permission in the Azure portal, each section will be in its own silo.

345. What is Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Azure RBAC and Active Directory Groups use RBAC concepts to create groups with specific permissions and assign users to those groups for easier administration.

346. What is a fault domain?
A fault domain is a set of hardware that shares a single point of failure, such as a VM host, rack, switch, or power source. In case of a failure, operations are spread across multiple fault domains to minimize impact. Fault domains are supported in Windows Server 2016 and later.

347. What are update domains?
Update domains are sets of servers that can be placed into maintenance mode simultaneously. For example, in a five-node cluster, each node could be in a separate update domain, allowing them to be rebooted one by one during maintenance without impacting availability.

348. What are Network Security Groups?
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are similar to Access Control Lists. They allow filtering of traffic and requests to specific servers. For instance, you can restrict access to a database server from only a pair of application servers.

349. How are Active Directory Domain Services (Standard ADDS), Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure ADDS) different?
Standard ADDS: Supports Kerberos, LDAP, and NTLM authentication and has Group Policies for managing large numbers of users and computers.
Azure ADDS: Supports Kerberos, LDAP, and NTLM, but lacks Group Policy support.
Azure AD: Primarily supports web-based authentication methods like OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0, and Open ID, and does not have GPO support.
All three can work together, with Standard ADDS synchronizing to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect, which in turn synchronizes with Azure ADDS.

350. What are the default password lockout settings for Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure ADDS)?
By default, if an account has five failed login attempts within two minutes, it is locked out for 30 minutes. This can be adjusted using fine-grained password policies (FGPPs).

351. What is Redis?
Redis is a large-scale, memory-intensive database application that handles enormous numbers of requests per second with low latency. Azure Cache for Redis is a full implementation of Redis, accessible by any application inside or outside of Azure, and can be used alone or with other database solutions like Azure SQL or Cosmos DB.

352. What is an availability set? If we want to add additional VMs to this after they are built, can we do this?
An availability set is a cluster of VMs that must always be available, even if some hardware fails. VMs in an availability set are placed on different hosts, racks, and storage to minimize the impact of a single outage. However, VMs can only be added to an availability set at creation time; existing VMs cannot be added later.

353. What is an Azure Virtual Network?
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) allows you to create standalone networks, connect to local networks, and access the internet. It’s recommended to select an IP range for your VNet that won’t conflict with existing IP ranges.

356. How is data secured on the back end?
Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Azure disk encryption uses Windows BitLocker and Linux DM-Crypt to encrypt entire disks.

357. What are managed disks?
Managed disks are block-level storage virtualized so they are not tied to specific hardware drives. This allows for easier movement and reduces potential data loss.

358. What is data warehousing?
Data warehousing compiles data from multiple sources into a single searchable index, similar to how credit ratings are calculated but for all digital entities.

359. Do we need to use a CDN when using Azure?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is useful for services with large amounts of user-facing media that need to be delivered quickly. For example, video streaming benefits from caching files globally to reduce latency. Whether you need a CDN depends on your specific use case.

360. We are currently a VMWare shop but are thinking of moving to Azure. Can we port any of our systems up?
Azure supports various hypervisors, including VMWare. You can vMotion a virtual machine to Azure if everything is configured correctly.

361. I am not a big fan of PowerShell. Is it required for managing Azure?
PowerShell is not required but can significantly reduce the time needed for task management with various cmdlets and scripts.

362. Would there be a way to make it so that when users sign into On-Site Active Directory, they are also automatically signed into Azure AD?
Yes, Azure AD Sync enables Single Sign-On, allowing users to log in once and access both on-site and Azure AD resources.

363. What is Azure Resource Manager and the Azure Traffic Manager?
Azure Resource Manager: A dashboard application for creating and deploying templates based on specific use cases.
Azure Traffic Manager: A load balancer that routes requests based on load, geography, and other factors.
364. We have a project coming up that will be generating an enormous amount of data. We were thinking of using Azure for Storage, but can it also assist with analyzing it?

365. Does Azure have any sort of monitoring capability? Logging, alerting, and so on?
Yes, Azure Monitor provides a unified solution for performance metrics, logging, and VM health monitoring.

366. If a piece of hardware powering our Azure setup fails, what happens?
If hardware fails and brings down a VM, Azure moves the VM to another host attached to the same storage. To ensure continuous service, it’s recommended to have multiple VMs running.

367. We need to sign an Azure Service-Level Agreement (SLA). What does this do?
An SLA defines the expected availability of a service. It specifies the maximum allowable downtime over a period. For example, Azure’s SLA for virtual machines guarantees 99.99% uptime, allowing for

368. If I need to access the Azure portal from my local system, is there a specific way to do this?
You can access the Azure portal through a web browser or use the Azure CLI/PowerShell for command-line access.

369. What is the difference between an Azure VM and an Azure App Service?
Azure VM: Provides a full virtual machine environment that you control, similar to a physical server.
Azure App Service: Provides a managed service platform for deploying web apps and APIs, handling underlying infrastructure automatically.
370. Is there a tool available to visualize my Azure environment?
Yes, Azure provides tools like Azure Resource Visualizer and Azure Diagrams to help visualize and manage your resources.

371. Why is Azure Diagnostics API needed?
Azure Diagnostics API helps us collect diagnostic data such as performance monitoring, system event logs, etc., from the applications that are running on Azure. For verbose monitoring of the data, Azure Diagnostics has to be enabled for the cloud service roles. The diagnostics data can be used for building visual chart representations for better monitoring and also for creating performance metric alerts.

372. Define Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
The Azure SLA is a contract that ensures or guarantees that when two or more role instances of a role are deployed on Azure, access to that cloud service is guaranteed for at least 99.95% of the time. It also states that if the role instance process is not in the running state, then the detection of such processes and corrective action for the same will be taken 99.9% of the time. If the mentioned guarantees are not satisfied at any point in time, then Azure credits a percentage of monthly fees to us depending on the pricing model of the respective Azure services.

373. What is Azure Resource Manager?
Azure Resource Manager is a service provided by Azure to provide management and application deployment in Azure. The resource manager provides the management layer that helps the developer to create, modify or delete the resources in the Azure subscription account. This feature comes in handy when we have requirements like managing access controls, locks, ensuring the security of the resources post-deployment, and organization of those resources.

374. What is NSG?
NSG stands for Network Security Group that has a list of ACL (Access Control List) rules which either allows or denies network traffic to subnets or NICs (Network Interface Card) connected to a subnet or both. When NSG is linked with a subnet, then the ACL rules are applied to all the Virtual Machines in that subnet. Restrictions of traffic to individual NIC can be done by associating NSG directly to that NIC.

375. What do you understand about cloud computing?
Cloud computing refers to the usage of computing resources (servers) on the internet (refers to the term cloud) for the purpose of storing, managing, analyzing, and processing the data. Here, instead of maintaining our own servers, we use the infrastructure provided and maintained by third-party vendors such as Microsoft, AWS, etc., and pay them based on the server usage time duration. Cloud computing enhances the speed of execution, ensures flexibility of resources, and easier scalability. It can be used to attain high fault tolerance and high system availability, dynamically adjusting as per the infrastructural requirements of the application.
